# Transcriptome Assembly Quality Assessment

The aim of (denovo) transcriptome assembly is to accurately reconstruct the complete set of transcripts that are represented in the read data (in the absence of reference genome)

In contrast of genome assembly, (**context**: if we have an organism with C chromosomes our optimal (ideally) genome assembly would consist of C long contigs) transcrimptome assembly (optimal) wil vary consist of all posible transcript from all expressed genes. ie. alternatively spliced variants (isoforms). 

Nevertheless there are several contributing factors than negatively affect the accuracy of the construction assembly process.

These factors include error in sequencing process (usually the batch effect is found here), incomplete coverage of transcripts (due to insuficient sequencing depth), real biological variability (ex. alternatively spliced variants) and algorithmic simplification. 

Usualy the most highly expressed transcript do not neccessary constitute the longjest one and the majority of transcripts in a transcriptome assembly will normally have relatively low expression levels.
